Entry to the Digital Logic and Design Project Exhibition and Competition. My team's project, Abyss Escape, was a horror game in which you guide a character using a joystick hooked up to an FPGA to get the key and exit under 100 seconds while avoiding a monster.

I was mainly in charge of the art direction of the project, but I also worked on writing Verilog code for aspects such as the monster AI, key and gate mechanic, and sundries. This project won 3rd place.
